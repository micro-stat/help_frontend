We provide a variety of integrations to make it quick and easy to connect your app with micro stat. This page will help you to learn about which integrations we offer for the technology in your app.

## What is an Integration
An integration is code we provide that you can install in your application. It gives you simple interfaces to take advantage of all the features micro stat can offer. It communicates with our API to ingest your data when you publish metrics.

Our integrations follow a common set of steps...
1. **Install** - by choosing the integrator applicable to the technology in your app
2. **Connect DSN** - to connect your app to your project in micro stat
3. **Publish Metrics** - so you can publish your own metrics in code

We built all of our integrations with the aim of making it super quick to get up and running in your app. We think you can publish your own metrics within 5 minutes of starting.

## What technologies do you support
We want to support every technology your app could be created in but it will take time for us to cover all the technologies available. If you want an integration in a technology we don't yet support, why not build it and share it with the community?
