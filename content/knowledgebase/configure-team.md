Our invitation capability is not yet publicly availably. We will release it soon, let us know if this is a blocker for you by submitting a ticket.

### How is access managed?
Access to projects in micro stat is controlled via organisations. When you sign up with micro stat we automatically create an organisation for you.

You can customise any organisation for which you are an administrator, and you can invite your team members to join it too.

Members can be part of more than one organisation, so if you are lucky to find yourself in multiple organisations you will be able to see all of the projects available in each of organisations you can access.

### How to invite my team?
If you are the administrator of an organisation you can invite your team members by visiting the `Settings` page in the Dashboard and then visit the "Your Organisation" page, then follow the steps below.
