- We provide a variety of integrations that make it quick and easy to connect your app with micro stat.
- This page will help you to learn about what integrations are, and which ones we offer for the technology in your app.

## What is an Integration
- An Integration is code we provide that you can install in your application. It gives you simple interfaces to take advantage of all the features micro stat can offer.
- Integrations communicate with our API to ingest your data when you publish metrics.
- We built all of our integrations with the aim of making it easy to get up and running in your app. We think you can publish your own metrics within 5 minutes of starting, let us know how you get on.

- All Integrations follow a common theme...
1. **Install** - Choose the integrator applicable to the technology in your app and install it
2. **Connect DSN** - Using the integration, connect your app to your project in micro stat
3. **Publish Metrics** - Define your metrics in code and publish them, they will be visible in the dashboard

## What Integrations are available?
- We want to offer an integration for every technology your app could be created in but it will take time for us to cover all the technologies available. 

- If you want an integration in a technology we don't yet support, why not build it and share it with the community? Alternatively let us know and we will prioritise the most asked for features. 
- If you can't see an integration you want, or simply prefer not to use one; feel free to use our API directly.
