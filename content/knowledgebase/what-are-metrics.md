Metrics are the most important part of micro stat, we use the term in two different ways.

1. A metric is the thing you are measuring, for example if you wanted to count how many cups of coffee you drink in a day, your metric exists solely to track just that.
2. Sometimes we use the word metrics (plural) to mean the individual data points that make up a metric.

So you define a metric - the thing you are measuring, and you data points to give it data.
