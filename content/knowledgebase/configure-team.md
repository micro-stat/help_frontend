Our invitation capability is not yet publicly availably. We will release it soon, let us know if this is a blocker for you by submitting a ticket.

## How is access managed?
- Access to projects in micro stat is controlled via organisations.
- When you sign up with micro stat we automatically create an organisation for you.
- You can customise any organisation for which you are an administrator, and you can invite your team members to join too.
- Members can be part of more than one organisation, so if you are lucky to find yourself in multiple organisations you will be able to access all of the projects available in each of organisations you can access.

## How to invite my team?
If you are an administrator of an organisation you can invite your team members by following the steps below.

1. Open the micro stat Dashboard
2. Switch to the organisation you want to invite your team into if you are part of more than one.
3. Go to the `Settings` page
4. Navigate to the `Your Organisation` page
5. Hit `Invite my Team`
6. Enter an email address so we can send an invitation to your colleagues inbox
7. Alternatively send the invitation code to your team member and ask them to `Join an Organisation`
