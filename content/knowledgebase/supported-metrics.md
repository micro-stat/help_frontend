There are a wide variety of metric types available, our aim is to make recording every type of data possible. If you can't see one that matches your use case please get in touch, we may put it on our roadmap.

## Currently Supported
1. Hit Counter
2. Timer
3. Counter

## Under development
We are actively working on adding new metric types as we speak, these are some of the ideas we are working on right now.

1. Word Map: The ability to pass a word as a metric value, and be able to represent which words are most frequently used.
