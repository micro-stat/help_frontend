Alerts are not yet publicly available

## What are Alerts?
- Alerts are designed to let you know quickly if something is going awry in your projects
- For example you might want to know that the number of exceptions in your application has exceeded expected thresholds
- We push alerts to you where you already are, we support the following mechanisms of delivery.

1. Directly posting a message into your Slack channel
2. Pushing alerts to PagerDuty
3. Sending you an email when an alert level is tripped

## How are alerts configured
- Alerts are an extension of the "thresholds" feature, you configure thresholds to highlight in your graphs when performance is good or bad
- It is also possible to attach an alert to a threshold, meaning you can know that data is performing badly without even looking at the Dashboard

## When can I use alerts?
- We aim to release this feature for public use soon, please be patient and let us know if you have any cool ideas.
